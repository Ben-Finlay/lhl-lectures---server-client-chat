# set of Rules for Computer communication
TCP -  Transmission Control Protocol

- Computer A wants to connected With Computer B (computer A NEEDS TO KNOW THE ADDRESS of B)
- Computer A KNOWS the Global IP of computer A
- Computer B SHOULD accept connection from Computer A
- Computer A attempts to connect with Computer B ( request/connection )
- if Connection gets established, Computer A sends its credentials to Computer B
- Computer A will listen to any messages that might come in....
- Computer B will listen to any messages that might come in....
- Computer A has an option to disconnect anytime..
- Computer B is a server therfore it will be always online, and it will always listen to connections


HTTP 

- Computer A wants to connected With Computer B (computer A NEEDS TO KNOW THE ADDRESS of B)
- Computer A KNOWS the Global IP(but also could be a URL) of computer A
- Computer A attempts to connect with Computer B
- Computer A sends a REQUEST 
- Computer B gets REQUEST and RESPONDS back
- Once the response is finished, Both computers disconnect from each other....
