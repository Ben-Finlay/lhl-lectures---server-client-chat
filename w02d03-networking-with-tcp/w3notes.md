Computer A enters credentials of computer B
Computer attempts to connect with computer B
2 COMPUTERS connected!!!
Computer A sends a message ------------> 
Computer B recieves a message 
Computer B sends a message back 
Computer A recieves that message
Once we are done...
Computer A disconnects
Computer B waits for others to connect.....

These are our Rules of Networking for computers

### TCP <-- Transmission Control Protocol

You connect
You stay connected
You do operations
You disconnect! 

### HTTP <-- https://www.google.ca

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

Computer A connects with Computer B
Computer A sends 1 MESSAGE (REQUEST)
Computer B sends 1 MESSAGE back (RESPONSE)
Computer A disconnects!
