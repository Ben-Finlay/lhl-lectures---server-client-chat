### Computer Communication (RULES of Computer communication by Vas)

Transmission Control Protocol

- We got a computer 
- We got another computer
- Computer A Connects to Computer B
- Computer B listens to info that computer A may send
- Computer A sends info, Computer B gets the info
- Once computer B gets info, computer B will forward it to another computer ( maybe ?)
- Computer A disconnects, Computer B hangs out there waiting for someone else to connect...

HTTP

- Computer A connects to Computer B
- Computer A ASKS for a resource 
- Computer B RESPONDS back with a resource
- Computer A and B disconnect
