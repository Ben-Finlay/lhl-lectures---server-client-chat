T C P 
Transmission Control Protocol


There is a server....
And there is a client ( or a bunch of clients)

The server gets initialized, and listens to connections..

A client can connect to a server

A Client can send a message to a server
A Server can send a message to a client

A client can disconnect~

A server can take a clients message, send it to another client ?
There needs a delay of some sort to make sure that client/server messages dont collide 
 ^---- there are two different ways to send messages
