-------- Agenda
Talk about Class Based Components

We going to write 2 apps, side by side
one in functional ( how you have been doing so far)
and one in Class based components

Class Based Components Why ?

if you jump on a project
that started at around 2018 or later chances are
some of the code is written in classes
some of it is written in functional
