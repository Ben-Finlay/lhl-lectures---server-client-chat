- data structure which saves data in tables and have relationship
- PERSISTANCE
- a database can be on a different computer!
- .txt to store data, you would have to build a language to interact with data to get it from and to that file.

- when its time to add features!!!!
- if we refresh our app ( restart ) we will lose our data...
