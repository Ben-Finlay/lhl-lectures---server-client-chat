Databases Overall (why and what)
SQL and Node - (Build an App)
(refactor of an app)

Whats a database?
- bunch of infromation that is stored to get your buisness done
- data structure which saves data in tables and have relationship
- PERSISTANCE

TinyApp 

const users = {}
const urlsDatabase = {}

node would restart..... which lose all the data in memory....

fs to write into a file all the data we want to persist.

psql (sql, mariaDB, couchDB, mongoDB) can run all a different machine.
