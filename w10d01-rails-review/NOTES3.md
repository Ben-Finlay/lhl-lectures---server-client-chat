--- All about Rails ---

entire rails review from top top 
from making models views controllers routes

- nested routes
- namespacing 
- rails api ()

-------- Rails ------------------



------------- Routes -------------
config/routes.rb is the entry point in our website
this is where rails decides where all of the routes go to.

------------ Controller -----------

The controller is responsible for logic that happens right before we send out 
response. Controller has actions(methods) and those methods are responsible for your routes.

------------ Views

the file that is sent back to the client
this is our html/css layouts that get generated by the server (server side rendered)
remember the action name = the view name, so that rails knows which view to send out

------------ Models

a blueprinbt for a table that lives in your db.
A model is a class that comes alot of pre-built db methods/quaries

   --- Migration
     its a specific record of adding/deleting/creating/changing a table in the database
     records of migrations are kept for history purposes and we never edit history!!!


   IF you are working on a branch, and you have added a bunch of migrations
   and you realized you forgot to add a col to one of the  migrations, THIS IS OK 
   TO ROLLBACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

   IF the migrations have been added to master, and have been deployed into production,
   this means the migrations are now in "history" and you cannot alter them (rollback). so you 
   will have add a new migration.
