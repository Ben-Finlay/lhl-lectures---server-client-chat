--- All about Rails ---

entire rails review from top to bottom 
from making models views controllers routes

- nested routes
- namespacing 
- rails api()


Rails is an MVC Framework 

routes.rb

One of the most important files on your rails files. This is the ENTRY POINT
of your app


Controller is a file that is responsible for logic of a specific route that was hit 
(this is determined by the action and routes.rb file)

View - the file that will be sent out to the client as a response (server side rendering)

------------------------------------

Models

Model is a blueprint of a table that is inside of the database
Models themselves have a few "methods/actions" built it for common database querying
A model can also assosiate itself with another model, to make JOIN queries much more easier
to write/work with



----- Migrations

a history of events for creating/deleting tables/columns from your database

RULES OF MIGRATIONS

-- NEVER EVER TOUCH Schema.rb --- this file is autogenerated !!!!

-- NEVER EVER GO BACK IN TIME TO FIX A MIGRATION -- always make a new one instead 
                               ^--- unless you changes haven't been commited to production
