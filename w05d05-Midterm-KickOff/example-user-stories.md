Here are some examples that we can use from tiny app:


```
As a user I want to be able to create short urls
by adding long url and app generating a short url
```

```
As a user I want to be able to edit my short urls
that I'have already added to my list of urls
```

```
As a user I want to be able to delete my own urls
```

```
As a user I want visit other user accounts and see
their urls
```

```
As a user I have the ability to choose if my short urls
are public ( everyone can see and share them ) or private.
```

```
As a user I want to see a counter of how many times my short url
was used by people
```

```
As a user I want to share my shortUrls with other users that they
can edit/delete them as they see fit
```
