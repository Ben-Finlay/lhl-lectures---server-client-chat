---------------- Agenda ----------------

Looking into how to build a project with a front-end
and backend(s)

- Rails
- Express
- React
- Pitfalls( mainly cors)
- Organization of Code ( alittle bit of Architecture )

-------------

Backend


- Rails 

What do we not need from rails if we're building our own front-end
  Views
  forms
  links
  tables
  ERB <%= %>
<-- 


rails new rails_backend_api --api


<------------ WHATS BETTER ?>

1 repo (front + back)
( commits !)

OR
2 repos ( front repo + back repo)



---------- WHAT IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN APP AND A WEBSITE ----------------
