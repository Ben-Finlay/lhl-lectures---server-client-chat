---------------- Agenda ----------------

Looking into how to build a project with a front-end
and backend(s)

- Rails
- Express
- React
- Pitfalls( mainly cors)
- Organization of Code ( alittle bit of Architecture )

-------------
Choice

2 - Repos ( front-end / backend seperated )
 - feature: display all users on a view 
      -#3- backend route /users
      -#3- frontend view /users 
      -#3- api call to backend 
      -#3- display users in a table/html format

-- Deployement, wouldnt it be easier to have 2 repositories instead of 1?



1 - Repo  ( front-end / bakcned folders )
  - feature: display all users on a view 
      backend route /users
      frontend view /users 
      api call to backend 
       display users in a table/html format



------------- PWA ---------------

PWA - React
  - easy to work, (HTML, JS)
  - has "most" of the features
  - COST (Cheaper)
  cons
  - heavy on the usage of memory on phone.....
React native
  - kind of "easy" to work with 
  - has all all the features to native
  cons
  - memory leaks...
  - cross support is iffy
Native (Java/Kotlin and Swift)
  very fast (because its native)
  very "customizable" 
cons
  - hard to work with (Java, Swift)
