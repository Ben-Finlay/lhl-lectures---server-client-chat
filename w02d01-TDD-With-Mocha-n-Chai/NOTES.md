-- Testing 

-- Why do we test?
----- test to make sure code will work!
----- once that test is written, it can be always reused
----- 60 file = 10 test
----- it not only saves you time, but it saves you weekends !! (do not do deploys on friday)


Test Driven Development 

-- We write tests first, and then we write the code after.
