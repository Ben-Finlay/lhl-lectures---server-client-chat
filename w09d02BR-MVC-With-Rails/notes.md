THE FIRST ENTRY POINT OF A REQUEST IN RAILS

goes to 

`routes.rb` <-------- THE MOST IMPORTANT FILE/PART of rails 

## Controller

Where all the logic of the request(s) will go

## View

The UI, ( what will be sent out to the client/request) to see

## Model 

Yesterdays work?

Whats active_record?

DID YOU WRITE ANY SQL QUERIES?

#### schema.SQL 

<!--  CREATE USER
 <!-- CREATE CATS-->  

 Model is a BLUEPRINT of a table in the database
 and it has those ORM methods so you dont have to write raw sql (activite_record)

 Migrations
 Migration - a piece of your SCHEMA.sql file

 make a table in SQL
 and i commit it 
 How do you know that you need to run the schema.sql again?
