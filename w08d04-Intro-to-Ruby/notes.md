---------------- Comparisons ------------------

---- Javascript ----
 - 10 days created in 1995 
 (Java was very popular, )
 - We can run in on the backend and the frontend
 express is back end framework, react is a front end framework 
 - Syntax of JS was inspired by Java and C
 - Async (highly performant)
 - js has one of the largest ecosystems of packages 
 - primative data types in JS and also object
 - JS is quite low level 

---- Ruby ---------- 

- 1995 BUT became popular in 2004-2005 (because of Ruby on Rails)
- created by Yukihiro Matz
- RUBY ONLY WORKS ON THE BACKEND!! 
- Ruby syntax is "simplified" (english-y)
- Everything in ruby is A CLASS/OBJECT
- A High langauge with LOTS OF ABSTRACTIONS <---
- Performance Issues :(   (sync)
- Ruby on Rails is very good for rapid prototyping 
- Ruby has a big ecosystem BUT NOT NEARLY AS BIG AS JS
