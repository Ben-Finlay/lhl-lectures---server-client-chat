------------- Agenda -------------

- Ruby talk ( what, why, how )
- Ruby vs JS Comparisons
- BREAK - 
- More Comparisons
- yield
- rails




--------------- Javascript ---------------------
10 days to create js -- 1995
Java so popular, Javascript
both can run in front-end and back-end
syntax is "borrowed" from and java
javascript is functional --- (classes, but they are syntatic sugar)
NPM --- 1.3 mill
js - has primative types -- boolean, string, int, double, float
ASYNC --- (callbacks, promises, async/await)
perfomant
express is quite a popular web framework


--------------- RUBY -----------------------------
1995 - Matsumoto (Matz) but it became very popular
at aroound 2004-05 because of Rails
Ruby CAN ONLY RUN in the backend
Ruby syntax is "simplified" ("pythonic")
Ruby is Class based ( OOP )
There are no primative variables
Ruby is SYNC 
less performant :(
ruby has a GEM library


---------  Ruby on Rails
is a MVC framework, and it is very well built 
configuration vs convention 


PERFORMANCE
