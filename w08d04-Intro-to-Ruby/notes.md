------------- Agenda -------------

- Ruby talk ( what, why, how )
- Ruby vs JS Comparisons
- BREAK - 
- More Comparisons
- yield
- rails

----------------- Javascript -------------
10 days created 1995 - Javascript, Java was popular,
we can run js on both Backend and frontend 
syntax of JS was inspired by java and c 
Async - ( Callbacks, Promises, and async/await) 
NPM - package manager - hundereds of thousands of packages 
JS has primative data types --- integer, float, double, etc
JS is quite low level -- 
JS is highly performant :)
JS has express which is a popular web framework, (configuration)

--------------- Ruby ---------------------
1995 BUT it became popular in 2004-2005 ( because of Rails framework)
- Created by a man named Yukihiro Matz
Ruby only can be run on the backend!
- ruby sintax is "simplified" 
- EVERYTHING IN RUBY is a class 
- its a synch languages ( things happen exactly how you write them...)
- Performance Issues :(
- Ruby/Rails - rapid prototyping -- (convention)
- Gems (thats what packages are called) -- big ecosystem of packages, 
BUT NOT NEARLY AS ENOUGH AS JS
