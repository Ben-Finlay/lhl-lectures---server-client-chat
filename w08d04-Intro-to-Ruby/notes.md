------------- Agenda -------------

- Ruby talk ( what, why, how )
- Ruby vs JS Comparisons
- BREAK - 
- More Comparisons
- yield
- rails

--------- Javascript -----------------
js was made in 10 days Javascript  --- 1995
can run both front-end and backend
syntax of js was inspired by java
async - (callbacks, promises and async/await )
NPM - millions of different packages/libraries/frameworks that you can use
js has primative datatypes (integer, string, boolean, float, double)
js is low level language
js is quite performant
js has express which is very popular right now!

------- Ruby ------------------------
1995 by Matz  BUT it became very popular in 2004 - 2005 because of the invetion of 
rails
Ruby can only run on the backend 
Ruby is Class based ( OOP )
Ruby syntax is "simplified" (english-y / pythonic )
its a sync programing language ( everything happens line by line )
   -> there is a way to inject a function to run inbetween ( some sort of a callback)

Performance issues :( 
Ruby/rails is very nice to write and/or prototype with
GEMS/budles -- thousands of packages, but not nearly close to as js
